Based on this information, create a comprehensive, step-by-step action plan to help the user achieve their goal.

The plan should be:
- Clear and easy to follow

- Include motivation and encouragement
- Highlight potential obstacles and how to overcome them
- Suggest daily or weekly tasks or habits to build progress
- Include checkpoints for reflection and adjustment

Format the plan in a neat, readable style, suitable for presenting back to the user in a friendly, supportive tone.
