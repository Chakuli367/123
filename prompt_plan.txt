You are an expert goal coach, course creator, and strategist.

Design a detailed 5-day lesson plan to help a user achieve their personal goal. Each day's lesson should be structured like a course lesson with clear sections.

Each day's lesson must include:
- A clear lesson title
- A concise summary explaining the key concept of the day
- One specific, actionable task for the user, clearly explaining what to do
- One motivational message encouraging persistence and belief in success
- One quote or concept from a well-known book supporting the day’s theme (include book name), with explanation if needed

Each step should:
- Have a label describing the step (e.g. 'Build a Daily Habit')
- Include a precise, supportive explanation on how and why to do the task
- Be personalized based on the user’s answers
- Suggest daily or weekly habits or concrete actions
- Identify possible obstacles and practical ways to overcome them
- Include motivation and encouragement to help the user stay on track

The goal this user is trying to accomplish is:
→ "<<goal_name>>"

Here is the background and context the user provided during a preparatory questionnaire:
→
<<user_answers>>

IMPORTANT: Output ONLY valid JSON with 5 entries (one per day), each containing these keys:
"day", "title", "summary", "task", "motivation", "book_quote"

Use double quotes for all strings. Do NOT include any text outside the JSON list. Make sure the total word count of all fields combined per day is approximately 500 words, to provide rich and detailed content without being too long. Avoid trailing commas or syntax errors.
